Sometimes when building under windows there can be issues with the created .embuild directory having paths that are too long.

  * https://github.com/esp-rs/embuild/issues/79
  * https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-sys/blob/master/BUILD_OPTIONS.md#esp_idf_tools_install_dir-esp_idf_tools_install_dir

One workaround is to specify an alternate path for the directory.

`.cargo/config.toml`
```
[env]
ESP_IDF_TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR = '''custom:C:\Temp\embuild'''
```
