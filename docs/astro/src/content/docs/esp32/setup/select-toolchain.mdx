There are two ways to use the esp toolchain

## Switch rustup

The first method is to change the default toolchain in use
```sh
# To switch to the custom esp toolchain that is installed
rustup default esp
# to switch back to the stable x86 toolchain
rustup default stable
```

## Toolchain config file

The second method is to create a file in the root of the project `rust-toolchain.toml`
With the following content in
```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "esp"
```
