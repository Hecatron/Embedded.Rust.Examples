# Ninja / CMake Install

As part of the build process we'll need both Ninja and CMake installed

## CMake

For CMake they provide insstallers

  * https://cmake.org/download/

## Ninja

For ninja there's isn't an installer for windows

  * https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases

But we can just extract it to a path such as
```
C:\Apps\dev-tools\ninja
```

Then add it do our path
