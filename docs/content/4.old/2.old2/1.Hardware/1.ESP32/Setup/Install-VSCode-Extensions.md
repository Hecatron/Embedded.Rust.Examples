# VSCode

Suggested Extensions


## rust-analyser

  * https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/3154

This seems to work better than the official rust extension for VSCode
Although it currently lacks the ability to set a custom rustc path at the time of writing
so tends to flag up false problems.
Still it works good for auto completion and syntax checking

## Task Explorer

This allows the running of tasks from a submenu at the bottom left corner of VSCode
Which I tend to find perferable to using the command pallette

## Debugging

I'm still experimenting to see which of these is the best with jtag for the esp32
although the cortex-debug one seems to work
