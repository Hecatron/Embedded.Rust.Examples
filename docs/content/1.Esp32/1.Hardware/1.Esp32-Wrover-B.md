  * https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-wrover-kit.html


## Flash Size

By Default the flash size is 4MiB (MegaByte)


## SPI RAM

For the RAM there is 512KiB (KiloBytes) or 4Mb (Megabits)
This is split into

  * 328k DRAM
  * 192k IRAM (Instruction Ram)


### PSRAM

There's also and additional 4Mb PSRAM on some boards such as the ESP-WROVER-B
called pseudo static RAM

Apparantley only 4Mb is accessible even when 8Mb is attached. but you can access the rest via bank switching
