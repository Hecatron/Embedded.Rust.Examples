While using the probe-rs tools I've found for stlink boards
the best approach is to not use the j-link driver, but just update the stlink firmware to the latest version

## JLink Firmware

I've tried flashing the jlink firmware to the stlink
using zadig to switch the "interface 2 Bulk device" to winusb

However this doesn't appear to work with probe-rs
